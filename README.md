# Fastify Typescript REST API Starter Project

## USP

This project sets up `fastify` with `typescript` in the most flexible way which is different from any tutorial or blog elsewhere.

## Dependencies
This project uses:

1. `prettier` for code formatting.
2. `@fastify/type-provider-typebox` as the type provider for fastify.
3. `fast-jwt` for JWT signing and verification.
4. `argon2` for pasword hashing.
5. `@fastify/swagger` and `@fastify/swagger-ui` for automatic swagger docs generation.
6. `config` for configuration management.
